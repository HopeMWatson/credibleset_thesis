# Introduction 
Genetic testing is increasing at rapid rates, as the cost of genotyping continues to become much cheaper. Genome Wide Assocation Studies began around 15 years ago. Many strong genetic assocations with simple heritability mechanisms have already been identified, while genetic assocations with complex genetic mechanisms and disease aetiology continue to be challenging. Determining which assocations, that is which mutations to investigate is both time and cost intensive. The overall aim of this study is to reduce the number of candidate causual SNPs to be considered out of a credible set of SNPs. This is done by improving the current methods of how the credible set is derived. 

# Background
The introduction is split into two sections of background to provide clarity from 1) scientific side - genetics, and 2) mathematics side - Bayesian statistics, described in light of the genetics information. 

# Genetics 

## What are genetic associations?
A genetic association is a change in the genetic code that alters the risk of disease. Changes occur in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variants (CNV), and indels (micro and microsatellites) 
Genetic association studies -> find associations.

## What is GWAS? 
Genome wide association studies identify genetic positions (loci) associated with different disease risks in a population. 

##Important Terms

A phenotype is an expressed trait of interest. This is typically a disease such as cancer or heart disease. In a case-control study, a person with the expressed phenotype of interest is a case, and the person without the expressed phenotype is a control. 

A genotype is the genetic makeup of a organism that will determine its phenotype. The genetic make up is a sequence of base pairs.

An allele is alternataive forms of a gene/trait that are found at the same place on a chromosome. 

Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) is the frequency (count) at which the second most common allele occurs in a given population. The MAF gives a reference to how commmon or rare a variant is. A MAF of 0.5 means that the frequency of that specific allele 

A haplotype is a group of alleles 



A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a

## Fine Mapping 
Fine mapping is a process in which researchers try and identify the most likely single or set of variants within which the causal variant should lie. 
What is fine-mapping A process to refine these lists of associated variants to a credible set most likely to include the causal variant
Assign well-calibrated probabiliites of causalility to candidate variants. Then connect these variants to likely genes - functional annotation.


## What is LD?
Linkage disequilibrium is the correlation structure that exists among DNA variants in the current human genome as a result of historical evolutionary forces, particularly finite population size (genetic drift), mutation, recombination rate, and natural selection [@Visscher2017]. In short, this correlation structure means that SNPs are not statistically independent of each other. LD makes it possible for 80 million SNPs to be arrayed by only 500kb-1Mb SNPs. However, LD also makes it difficult to indicate which SNP is causal and which is a highly correlated neighboring SNP. 
Different genes have different recombination probabilities, and therefore genetic distance does not equal physical distance. 

LD is expressed by 





## Types of Methods 

### Lead SNP (smallest p-value)
A previous and simple approach was to consider all SNPs of a certain threshold (5 x 10^-8) as potential candidates for causality. There are several issues with this, as p-values are influenced by study specific factors such as power (sample size), minor allele frequency, and the effect size (rarely known). Differences in these variables make genetic studies difficult to compare. [@Spain2015]

### Lead SNP and LD "friends (i.e. r\textsuperscript{2}>0.8)

Another method used was to take the lead SNP, that is the SNP with the highest p-value, and compare it with a certain LD threshold, typically r\textsuperscript{2}>0.8) and consider these neighboring SNPs as the potential causal SNP. This method still ignores properties of the study or locus, as greater power can differentiate SNPs in higher LD. 

### Bayesian method

Association p-values converted to Bayesian posterior probabilities of causality under specific assumptions.  These can be summed over sets of variants to generate a posterior probability a causal variant lies in any given set.

Bayesian methods are not directly influenced by study 

Credible sets - involves sorting

## Posterior Probability 
The Bayesian's belief in a binary hypothesis (eg this SNP is causal vs this SNP is not causal) after seeing the data.  Note difference to prior belief.  Bayes Theoreom

\begin{equation}
\label{eq-Bayes Theorem}
P(X=x|D)
= \frac{P(X=x) P(D|X=x)}{P(D)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq-Bayes Theorem}
{P(X=x|D)}
 = \frac{P(D|X=x) P(X=x)}{\sum(P(D|X=y)(P(X=y))}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq-Bayes Theorem}
{P(X=x|D)}
 \propto {P(D|X=x) P(X=x)}
\end{equation}

statistical probability that a hypothesis is true, calculated in light of relevant observations. Relavant observations may be defined as both the prior information and the new data that is being analysed, both which together generate the posterior probability. For this reason, the posterior probability is proportionally related to the prior, by the expression of the newly observed data. 

#Relationship between p-values and Posterior Probabilities 
The relationship between p-values and posterior probabilities is an inverse relationship. The smaller the p-value which represents the likelihood of observing the data given the null hypothesis, the higher the posterior probability. 

- typically, the SNP is not associated with the 

# Bayesian Statistics 
## Contrast with Frequentist 
In a frequentist framework a parameter of interest (mean, proportion, rate)  is fixed and only varies due to sampling variation. The process of inferring the value of the parameter works by considering every possible result that a study could potentially generate. That is under the same conditions, what would be observed under multiple parallel imaginary samples. However this is not possible many biological phenomia, where a hypothesis such as 'What is the porobabilty that a SNP is causal, given the data currently accrued?' #Kirkwood2005 There is no interpretation of this hypothesis in frequentist terms, since there is a fixed but unknown quantity of the SNP (functional genomic issues such as gene expression under the frequentist interpretation).  In frequentist statistics the null hypothesis is assumed to be true; that is, it is the starting point of all inference that the observed data is compared to. The P-value reflects the probability of observing data as or more extreme than the data actually observed in current study, given the null hpyothesis; this framework does not allow for competing hypotheses. [@Gurrin2000]. A 95% confidence interval is interpreted as if new data were to be repeatedly sampled and analysed, 19 out of 20 intervals would include the true quantity parameter being estimated. 
Bayesian statistics incorporate pre-exisitng information into analyses, in the form of a prior, which is a belief of the distribution of the data before any new data has been observed or incorporated in analysis. This can come a variety of forms such as previous studies, consultation with experts, or theorectical biological models. Under these conditions, spelt out by the Bayes Theorem, a parameter is correctly interpreted as the probability of a hypothesis , given the observed data. 


## Credible interval
A credible interval is a range of values within which an unobserved parameter values falls within a particular subjective probability [Edwards1963]. 


--Unlike in frequentist statistics, in Bayesian we are asking what is the likelihood of a hypothesis, given the data we have observed. The data we have observed is represented by both priors - information that was already known that can be incorporated into analysis of the newly observed data. 

## Credible set

A set of SNPs that contains the causal variant with a pre-specified probability. Each SNP has an assigned prior probability and a posterior probability is calculated, using the likelihood of the data observed. The set is determined by a threshold of desired cumulative poster probabiities to reach this cutoff. 


## Issues with Credible Sets 
There is currently no explicit quantitiative definition for a credible set as there is for a credible interval. 

## Size of credible set
For one credible set, the size of the credible set is the belief that the credible set contains the causal variant (eg 90%). 

## Coverage of credible set
If we repeat analysing a list of credible sets, coverage is the amount of times the causal variant is in that credible set. Here coverage can be defined as number of times the causal variant was in the credible set out of the number of simulations run. This can be expressed as a percentage where if 10 credible sets are analysed and 9 of these credible sets include the causal variant, there is 90% coverage. 


# Link with Frequentist 
Link between a frequentist confidence interval and a bayesian credible interval with an uninformative prior. When Bayesian framework is used, but the prior belief is uninformative, the posterior probability is derived from the observed data, defined by the likelihood. An uninformative prior mathematically takes the form of uniform distribution, so that any probability in the distribution has the same proportion. This is similar to frequentist probabilities, which only use the data to estimate the unknown parameter. Under this framework, a parameter of interest credible interval, the posterior probability a SNP is causal can be interpreted 



## Scope of the Study: 
This study is done under the one causal variant assumption, meaning there is only one causal variant per credible set. This assumption creates some limitations that are outlined here. 
Colocalization is when a single SNP is associated with multiple phenotypes. Some methods used for colocalization calculate posterior probabilities works by fine mapping each trait under a single causal variant assumption. The two posterior probabilites are then integrated over to calculate probabilities that those variants are shared [@Fortune2018]. Therefore, this analysis may be able to be extended to involve colocalization in the future but is not addressed at this time.  

Copy number variants (CNVs) and variable number tandem repeat (VNTRs) consisting of microsatellites and minisatellites mutations, may account for a 10-15% of heritable gene expression variation in humans [@Gymrek2016]. Repetitive DNA is not easily analysed by next generation DNA sequencing methods, which struggle with homopolymeric tracts, that is, parts of the genotype that have the same base pair type repeated many times. Bi-allelic SNPs are not subject to this issue in the way CNVs and VNTRs are, which means they are more easily assayed. This analysis does not address the potential importance of CNVs and VNTRs and assumes that the causal variant can is a bi-allelic SNP. 

Functional annotations are added information known about a SNP in how it effects expressed phenotypes. Functional annotations are typically expressed as coding or non-coding regions of the genes 
Although not explored here, methods outlined in this study could be explored by altering the assigned prior value of a SNP in finemap.abf. Reweighting of the posterior probabilites can be done by using fGWAS [Pickrell2014] or PAINTOR methods [@Kichaev2014]. eQTL - expression quantitative trait loci - level of gene expression in a particular tissue 

Different trans-ancestries have different LD patterns. This study does not address any trans-ancestry differences or geographical analysis of subpopulations and their respective potential subtypes.  A SNP that has a small p-value across groups that have different genetic architecture shows a stronger genetic assocation to a phenotype than if it were present in only one of the groups. In this analysis only one LD matrix is considered at a time, but this could be extended in the future, particularly with relevant open data access from sources such as 1000 Genomes Project.

## Aims 
This study aims to prove that current fine mapping practices could be made more efficient to obtain a smaller credible set size. To do this, a metric to capture the amount of disorder in the system - the set of SNPs, was created. Through this method, we are able to say that by making the SNPs with the highest posterior probabilites always incorporated in the credible set through ordering, this contains more information about each SNP. By incorporating the information that SNPs with high posterior probabilities are more likely to be causual, the specified threshold can be reached using a smaller credible set.

##Should go somewhere else soon, but in the flow 

The measure of disorder can be viewed as a statistical annotation that allows us to have more confidence that the causal variant is contained in the credible set, when candidate SNP(s) have much higher posterior probabilities than the entire full set of SNPs being tested.

##Relationships to Ordering 
##Size
The relationship between ordering and size is an inverse relationship. This is simple to see in an example. Say there are 100 SNPs and the 97th one is the SNP with the lowest p-value, and therefore has the highest posterior probability

## Entropy
A measure of a system's disorder.

# Methods

## Why use Simulations?
Simulations are the gold standard in evaluating methodologies relevant to causal variants. In the "real-world", that is genotyping for actual phenotypes of interest (typically a disease), we do not know the causal variant. It is not possible evaluate both real-world data and the robustness of the methodology simulataneously. This is because the lack of certainty and variability of both parameters may be the reason for the outcomes; a basic concept of the scientific method -- test one variable at a time and hold all other variables the same as controls. 

## Running Simulations

Simulations were run by through a series of steps, leveraging relevant available R packages. Full code described here is available on: https://github.com/HopeMWatson/credibleset_thesis/blob/master/coverage%20.Rmd

The libraries utilised in this analysis were devtools to load the simGWAS and coloc packages directly from github. ggplot2 package was used to produce figures. The simGWAS package directly simulates GWAS summary data, without indivudal data as an intermediate step. The expected statistics are mathemathically derived for any set of causal variants and their effects sizes, conditional upon control haplotype frequencies [@Fortune2018]. The arguements for simGWAS to run require a specifation of the causal SNP, its effect size (OR), and allele (MAF) and haplotypes frequencies.
