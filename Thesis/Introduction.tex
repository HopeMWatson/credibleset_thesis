Genetic testing is increasing at rapid rates, as the cost of genotyping continues to become much cheaper. Genome Wide Association Studies began around 15 years ago. Many strong genetic associations with simple heritability mechanisms have already been identified, while genetic associations with complex genetic mechanisms and disease aetiology continue to be challenging. Determining which associations, that is which mutations to investigate is both time and cost intensive. The overall aim of this study is to reduce the number of candidate causal SNPs to be considered out of a credible set of SNPs. This is done by improving the current methods of how the credible set is derived. This process enables statistical associations to be converted into target genes.
